## 📁 Project Structure
```
Seat-BookingWebsite/
├── index.html # Booking interface
├── style.css # Seat layout & form styling
└── script.js # Seat logic & form handling
```

## 🧩 How It Works
- Seats are presented as clickable elements indicating available, selected, or occupied.

- Clicking toggles selection, and once the user fills the form and submits, booking info and seat choices are stored in the browser.

- Reloading the page retains booking status via local storage.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- HTML5 for structure

- CSS3 for layout and responsiveness

- JavaScript (ES6+) for dynamic seat handling and data persistence

## 🚀 Future Enhancements (Ideas)
- Add multiple rows/sections or seat categories (e.g. Premium, Standard)

- Integrate with a backend and database for real seat availability and bookings

- Allow real-time updates across sessions or users using WebSockets

- Add seat pricing, filters, or dynamic seat status updates
